** Installation

The library is available as a rubygem.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
gem install btce
#+END_SRC

** Basic Usage

Populate the file =wex-api-key.yml= along the same lines as the example.

The only thing that 99% of the people using the library will want to do with it:

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
require 'btce'
ticker = Btce::Ticker.new "btc_usd"
#+END_SRC

This should return something resembling:

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
#<Btce::Ticker:0x00000000d5d9a0 @operation="ticker",
                                @pair="btc_usd",
                                @json={"ticker"=>{"high"=>127,
                                                  "low"=>87.301,
                                                  "avg"=>107.1505,
                                                  "vol"=>4240695.81634,
                                                  "vol_cur"=>39298.55663,
                                                  "last"=>115,
                                                  "buy"=>115,
                                                  "sell"=>114.499,
                                                  "server_time"=>1366406293}}>
#+END_SRC

** Commonly Encountered Errors

*** Querying the endpoint more than once a second.

You can only query BTC-e's endpoint at most once a second currently.
If you see something similar to the following error, that is probably what you are encountering.


#+BEGIN_SRC
Same nonce is sent for every request.

{"success"=>0, "error"=>"invalid nonce parameter; on key:1409032186, you sent:1409032186, you should send:1409032187"}
#+END_SRC
